    "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm (way to classify programming languages based on their features) based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields called attributes, and code, in the form of procedures called methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. In this brand of OOP, there is usually a special name such as `this` or in case of Python `self` used to refer to the current object. In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a  multi-paradigm programming language and it supports object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with imperative, procedural programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages that support object-oriented programming (OOP) typically use inheritance for code reuse and extensibility in the form of either classes or prototypes. Those that use classes support two main concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Classes**: The definitions for the data format and available procedures for a given type or class of object; may also contain data and procedures (known as class methods) themselves, i.e. classes contain the data members and member functions\n",
    "* **Objects**: Instances of classes (in a computer system, any time a new context is created based on some model, it is said that the model has been instantiated). \n",
    "* **Instance**: Each object is said to be an instance of a particular class (for example, an object with its name field set to \"Mary\" might be an instance of class Employee). \n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are accessed somewhat like variables with complex internal structure, and in many languages are effectively pointers, serving as actual references to a single instance of said object in memory within a heap or stack. They provide a layer of abstraction which can be used to separate internal from external code. External code can use an object by calling a specific instance method with a certain set of input parameters, read an instance variable, or write to an instance variable. Objects are created by calling a special type of method in the class known as a constructor. A program may create many instances of the same class as it runs, which operate independently. This is an easy way for the same procedures to be used on different sets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in object-oriented programming are known as methods. Variables are also known as attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Method**: A programmed procedure that is defined as part of a class and is available to any object instantiated from that class. Each object can call the method, which runs within the context of the object that calls it.\n",
    "* **Attribute**: A particular property of an object, element or file. It can also refer to a specific value for a given instance of that property.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods and attributes can either belong to the class itself or to the instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class Methods**: belong to the class as a whole and have access to only class variables and inputs from the procedure call.\n",
    "* **Instance Methods**: belong to individual objects, and have access to instance variables for the specific object they are called on, inputs, and class variables.\n",
    "* **Class Attributes**: data that belongs to the class as a whole, shared among all instances; there is only one copy of each one \"synchronized\" among instances.\n",
    "* **Instance Attributes**: data that belongs to individual objects; every object has its own copy of each one."
